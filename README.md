# UFO Sightings

## Project Overview 
In this project we are helping Dana build a table using stored data in Javascript array. We have created multiple criteria by means of filters in the webpage that will allow users to pick UFO sigtings at different dates, cities, state, country and various UFO shapes. 

## Purpose
Dana main goal is to create an interactive webpage that will allow users to parse the data around various UFO sightings. 

## Methodology
We have used Javascript and bootstrap to make the webpage. We have created an HTML page that will allow users to pull information from the Javascipt data file using various filters.

## Results
Once the HTML page is up and running, the users would see the the main page with a title at the top and as they go through the webpage, they will all the details in more depth about UFO sigtings.

The next thing any user will see, are the different filters that we created (date, city, state country, shape) which can then be used to pull sightings for specific search criteria. Multiple filters can be used at the same time to get the desired information.

## Summary
The webpage created has different filters to get the most of the information we want but one drawback is lack of good validation process. The comments do validate the sightings with a vague description. There should be more concrete information described in the data.
### Recommendation
1. To have a better description of the sightings in the data. We should add how many people were available at that time and are ready to comment on this.
2.The webpage should be build more dynamically and should be easily updated if more cities, dates, states or countries are added.
